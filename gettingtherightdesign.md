## Problem and Solution Overview
In today’s society, many quantify personal success with awards and achievements instead of happiness and health. Such a mindset causes people to prioritize their work over all else, and many people neglect both their physical and mental health - according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, “1 in 5 U.S. adults experience mental illness each year” [1]. Bullet journaling is an existing method for people to manage their schedules or thoughts, and focuses on improving efficiency and mindfulness. However, it is inconvenient, time-consuming, and intimidating. It currently exists as a physical form where people can spend hours designing their journal spreads, only to abandon them after infrequent use. The online journaling community can also be intimidating for those with limited art experience, as many journalists use social media to share their extravagant spreads.

Our proposed solution, Pocket Planner, transforms bullet journaling into a hybrid digital and physical experience with a smart journal and an app. This maintains the same efficiency as bullet journaling but removes the restriction of a paper journal, making it portable and convenient. By providing people with semi-automated tracking, clear data visualization, and different methods to record their emotions, Pocket Planner can personalize bullet journaling to make it more efficient, empowering, and accessible to all.


## Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants
We conducted our design research through semi-structured interviews with people who currently journal or used to journal but quit, diary studies with people who do not journal at all, and contextual inquiries with people who used to journal but have adapted their methods. Our goal was to understand how people viewed bullet journaling and how they practiced self-reflection and daily planning.

Each research method helped us narrow down our tasks and exposed both important and inconvenient aspects of bullet journaling. Our contextual inquiry showed that a paper journal forces people to flip back and forth while transferring information between pages. The diary studies indicated how people with limited experience with tracking and journaling approached the idea of bullet journaling. Our interview participants also modified their journaling methods over the years to suit their own schedules and comfort levels. Understanding participant perspectives regarding the hardships of a physical journal while still acknowledging the importance of a tactile experience helped us refine our thinking and approach.

### Stakeholders and Participants
#### Semi-Structured Interviews and Contextual Inquiries
**Participant 1:** We conducted a semi-structured interview with Cathy, a 27-year-old woman who retired 2 years ago and is now a stay-at-home mother. She used to journal but it was too time-consuming, so she switched to using a pre-printed planner. Writing things down helps her stay organized, but paper planners are not portable. Cathy believes bullet journaling with others can help her stay accountable and motivated. 

**Participant 2:** We conducted a semi-structured interview with Betty, a 22-year-old masters student at UW who uses Google Sheets to manage her tasks. She likes the customization and synchronization of an electronic form, since she can access her journal across different platforms. Betty would like a journal that displays statistical data, such as how many steps she takes or how many books she has read.

**Participant 3:** We conducted a semi-structured interview and contextual inquiry with Jane, a 24-year-old tax accountant intern and graduate student at SU. She used to design her own journal templates, but now uses a pre-printed planner to save time. Writing notes on paper helps her actively register information. Jane tracks her weekly schedule to prevent herself from getting overwhelmed. During the contextual inquiry, she frequently flipped back and forth while transferring events between spreads.

**Participant 4:** We conducted a semi-structured interview with Abby, a 19-year-old undergraduate at UW studying architectural design. She has bullet journaled for over 5 years to track her tasks, mood, and activities. Her bullet journaling has evolved from intricate monthly spreads to practical daily entries, which has helped relieve her anxiety. She enjoys writing or doodling with pens and paper, but thinks that digital journals are more convenient.

#### Diary Studies
We designed a bullet journal template to conduct diary studies with five people who did not bullet journal before. Most of them already had their own methods for planning, such as Google Calendar or paper planners. During the diary studies, our participants barely filled out the trackers because they forgot to use their journals, left them at home, or did not find any reason to write anything down.
